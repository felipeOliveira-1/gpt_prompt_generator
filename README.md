## OpenAI Prompt Generator, Expert Simulation with Prompt Filter
This Python script uses OpenAI's GPT-4 engine to simulate a variety of experts in different scenarios. The user selects an option from a list, and the AI generates a response according to the chosen role and prompt. Additionally, the script features a critical mode, where the AI can critique and improve its own generated content. A unique aspect of this script is the prompt filter, which helps create more refined prompts for the AI to answer.

## Features
