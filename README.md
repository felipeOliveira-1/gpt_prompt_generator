## OpenAI Prompt Generator, Expert Simulation with Prompt Filter
This Python script uses OpenAI's GPT-4 engine to simulate a variety of experts in different scenarios. The user selects an option from a list, and the AI generates a response according to the chosen role and prompt. Additionally, the script features a critical mode, where the AI can critique and improve its own generated content. A unique aspect of this script is the prompt filter, which helps create more refined prompts for the AI to answer.

## Features
Prompt Filter: A roleplay-based filter that refines the user's input to create a perfect prompt for the AI.
Simulate Expert: The AI simulates an expert in a chosen field.
Challenge Narrative: The AI provides examples contradicting a given dominant narrative.
Write in Different Styles: The AI generates content in various writing styles and tones.
Accelerate Learning: The AI explains a complex topic in simple terms, as if the user were 11 years old.
Consult Celebrity: The AI criticizes an argument or opinion as if it were a specific person.
Social Media Plan: The AI generates a creative social media content calendar for a product or company.
