## Prerequisite
* Python 3.7 or later
* OpenAI API key (sign up for one at https://beta.openai.com)

## Built With
* Python - The programming language used
* OpenAI API - The API used to generate the prompt

## Installing
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the repository
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```Python
pip install openai
```
4. Replace API-key in the code with your OpenAI API key
5. Run the script by executing the following command:
```Python
python gpt3_prompt_generator.py
```
6. Follow the prompts in the terminal to generate a response from GPT-3

## Usage
To use the program, run the prompt_generator.py script from the command line. You will be prompted to select an option, enter a desired prompt, and provide additional information and context. The program will then generate a response using the GPT-3 API and print it to the console.

## Options
Here are the available options for generating prompts:

1. Simulate an expert
2. Challenge the conventional narrative
3. Use unconventional prompts
4. Write in different styles or tones, such as satire or irony

Select the option that best suits your needs, and follow the prompts to generate a response. Once the prompt is generated, the program uses the OpenAI API to generate a response based on the user's input. If the user selects to enter critical mode, the program generates a new prompt for the user to act as a critic and provide a new response.

## Limitations
Please note that the GPT-3 API is not perfect, and the prompts generated by this program may not always be accurate or appropriate. Use your own discretion when using the prompts generated by this program, and always double-check the information provided.
